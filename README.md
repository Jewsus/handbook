# Pryaxis Operator's Manual

This is the open source manual for the Pryaxis organization. More specifically, this guide contains everything needed to know:

* What Pryaxis is, on a more formal level.
* How Pryaxis operates and who makes the decisions.
* How to perform technical procedures, like updating TShock.

## What is Pryaxis [the organization]?

Pryaxis is kind of a loose collection of people that have had several names. Originally, it was called _The TShock Team_, as it was primarily the team that developed TShock. When we realized that we might want to do something other than TShock, we picked _Nyx Studios_ as our next name. Now, we go by _Pryaxis_. Effectively, we're an open source development crew with hopefully some added perks, once we can get our act together and get some free time.
