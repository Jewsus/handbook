# Banning

When someone violates the community code of conduct, or when we decide that a member needs to be removed, we can ban them.

## When do we ban someone?

That depends on a lot of things. If someone breaks the code of conduct or acts erroneously once, a leader should be able to warn the user and stop them from continuing.

Banning should only be a thing that happens when _a user has been warned repeatedly_ about either one subject or many subjects and has yet to understand the implications of being in the community. Banning should be taken as a step to _ensure the community's safety, harmony, and success, as a unit_, not as a punishment as a direct result of an action. It isn't that we ban someone to prove a point, but rather, it's that we ban someone to ensure the future health of the community.

A consensus must be reached prior to ban. These consensus windows should be shorter than three days. If exigent circumstances exist, a temporary ban may be placed while we determine a final verdict on what to do about a situation.

## How do we ban someone?

We should be consistent across all services. A ban on Discord is equivalent to a ban on the forums, as well as an organization block on GitHub.

## When do we reverse bans?

We don't. Or at least, we really shouldn't. In the past, we've had a lot of problems with this. If someone is banned, we should have reached a consensus and kept tabs on why someone is banned or what they did to deserve it.

In general, if we reverse too many bans or if we take into account invalid arguments when reversing bans, it makes our policy less strong. A weak policy is worse than no policy, because it implies that we ourselves are weak. It implies that we, the team, don't have a cohesive voice.

## Ban on sight or turn the other way?

Ban on sight. If it becomes known that someone is using a sock puppet, we should ban the sock puppet and make a note that they were an alternate account of a banned user.

This is a going forward, non-retroactive policy from implementation date. We don't really care about "known alts" that exist under this policy.
