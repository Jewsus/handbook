# RFC Process

When something is unclear, a request for comments can be made. An RFC can be made about a policy, about a policy change, a member of the community, a localized event, or anything else.

RFCs are effectively precedent setting documents that help address nuances not covered in the handbook explicitly. Rather than try to list out every possible thing we can or cannot encounter, RFCs help address questions anyone has, operation wise.

## Required Elements

An RFC needs to have at least three key components:

- A discussion with the leadership team. It can happen over GitHub issues in this repo or in another repo. It can happen in voice chat or over Discord chat.
- Consensus data. Preferably, we have everything happen for voting on an issue over GitHub using code reviewers. Either way, each RFC needs at least a voting record of who supported the RFC going forward. If it doesn't meet minimum consensus, don't publish it. For sensitive issues, consensus data can be kept private (e.g., rather than listing members present for a meeting about a user's banning, you can just say that 5 team members participated in the decision).
- Synthesized problem and solution. The problem statement should be as direct as possible and include a bulleted list of deciding factors that led to the decision. The solution should be clear and direct too. One person can make this synthesis.

The RFC must be put in this repo to become official. If all three ingredients are included, the final RFC document can just be put in the rfc folder directly. Name it something sensible like ```date-rfc-topic.md```.

If the RFC discussion or consensus data is happening over GitHub, it should take the form of a pull request and issue combination.

An RFC is not official unless it has a clear consensus, discussion, and a synthesized problem and solution. It also has to be in this repo.

The final document is what counts. How you get there is a different story: if there's a consensus and you did it via email, that's a bit arcane but it does work. GitHub is convenient for some but not others, and sometimes the decision is obvious (e.g., everyone was in voice chat and we don't want to make an issue and leave comments just to be pedantic).
